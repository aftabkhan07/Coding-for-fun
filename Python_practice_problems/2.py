# Write a Python program to get all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n. Go to the editor
# A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the 
# same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down 
# (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).
